Idea for gaining more members:
	-Reach out to engineering groups on campus, gather interested members
	-Reach out to AWICS


Programs we can start:
	-weekly meetings - overview of these topics
	-"industry nights" - get credit for going to events that we host

What do we want to get out of this group?
	-Easiest, and arguably most important effect we can have: self awareness

How can we start to grow?
	-Reach out to existing groups focusing on underrepresented/minority groups
		-Can they provide material that can help us learn how to move forward/learn why diversity is important?
	-Aggie Allies
	-SHIP - Society of Hispanics in Engineering
	-AWICS - Aggie Women in Computer Science

Can we speak with President Young?
-How can we as a university start to address issues in diversity and move forward?
-What can we do to help him in his efforts to promote diversity?


Aggie Allies Type Group
	-We want to hold a series of training seminars
	-People who want to learn more about this/become more sensitive to issues regarding inclusion/diversity


Course Presentations:
	-Engineering Honors 181
	-Engineering 111,112
	-Upper Level Seminar Courses
	-Easier to plug into existing structures than to start from scratch
	-We should develop an hour long presentation
		-What should this include?
			-format that has worked: presentation, followed by dialogue
			-how can we get across to people?
				-we don't want to tell people that we're right they're wrong
			-We can talk about why diveristy is important
			-We need to be prepared for arguments we might hear
				-For example: We need to be able to refute the inevitable arguments about why the wage gap doesn't exist
			-Why is diversity important?

Intel Visit
-What do we want to learn?
	-Can we ask people who work there what it's like? What is the environment like?
		-We can hopefully learn about individual employees' experiences

	-What kind of programs exist at Intel to promote diversity and inclusion?

	-Ask Dr. Fletcher if we can arrange talking to a panel of Intel employees
		-Questions to ask panel:
			-If you could go back to your college self, what would you tell yourself knowing what you know now?

111,112:
	-To include in curriculum:
		-Ethics in the workplace (in addition to ethics in engineering)

Next Aggie Allies training: 
	Wednesday April 27, 5pm-8pm, Evans Library Room 204A
